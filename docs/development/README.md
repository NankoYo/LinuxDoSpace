## Current project state

- The Go backend already provides Linux Do OAuth, server-side sessions, CSRF checks, managed-domain allocation, DNS record management, and administrator APIs.
- SQLite persistence, Cloudflare integration, Docker packaging, and GHCR-based release workflows are in place.
- The main frontend is connected to the backend and supports the current public/user flows.
- The standalone `admin-frontend/` project is no longer just a UI prototype. It now uses real backend administrator sessions and management APIs.
